# PDM Copier

[Copier](https://github.com/copier-org/copier) template
for Python projects managed by [PDM](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm).

This copier template is mainly for my own usage,
but feel free to try it out, or fork it!

## Features

- [PDM](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm) setup, with pre-defined `pyproject.toml`
- Documentation built with [pdoc3](https://pdoc3.github.io/pdoc/)
- Pre-configured tools for code formatting, quality analysis and testing:
    - [black](https://github.com/psf/black),
    - [blacken-docs](https://github.com/adamchainz/blacken-docs),
    - [ssort](https://github.com/bwhmather/ssort),
    - [ruff](https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff),
    - [mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy),
- Tests run with [pytest](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest) and plugins, with [coverage](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy) support
- Python 3.9 or above
- Auto-generated `CHANGELOG.md` from git commits (using Angular message style)
- All licenses from [choosealicense.com](https://choosealicense.com/appendix/)

## Quick setup and usage
### Prerequisite
Install pipx, then copier and pdm with:

```bash
sudo apt install pipx
pipx install pdm
pipx install copier
```

Add your git identifiers:

```bash
git config --global init.defaultBranch master
git config --global user.name "Prenom NOM"
git config --global user.email "prenom.nom@spacex.com"
git config --global pull.rebase true
```

### Project creation 
To create a project, type:

```bash
copier copy --trust https://github.com/ydethe/pdm_template.git /path/to/your/new/project
```

See the [documentation](https://copier.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
for more details.

This command creates:
* The `pyproject.toml` file. [See here](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/writing-pyproject-toml) for more information
* A virtual environment in the project's folder, called .venv
* A [src-layout](https://backend.pdm-project.org/build_config/#the-src-layout) for the project's sources
* A `tests` folder, with an example test that can be run with [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/8.0.x/): `pdm run pytest`
* A `.gitignore` file customized for python
* A [`.pre-commit-config.yaml`](https://pre-commit.com/#2-add-a-pre-commit-configuration) file that embeds the following hooks:
    * `check-changelog` to update the `CHANGELOG.md` file ([see on github](https://github.com/ydethe/pdm_template))
    * `extract-todo` to extract TODO comments from code and write it in `TODO.md` ([see on github](https://github.com/ydethe/pdm_template))
    * `check-case-conflict` to check for files that would conflict in case-insensitive filesystems
    * `check-merge-conflict` to check for files that contain merge conflict strings
    * `mixed-line-ending` to replace or check mixed line ending
    * `trailing-whitespace` to trim trailing whitespace
    * [`black`](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to refactor code
    * `blacken-docs` to run black on python code blocks in documentation files
    * [`ruff`](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) to check code consistency
* A `CHANGELOG.md` file (updated by pre-commit hooks) that describes the changes between two git tags
* A `README.md` file that describes your project
* A `TODO.md` file that keeps track of all 'TODO' comments in your code

### Usage
**In the case where you just created a package with copier**

You can:
* activate the venv: `source .venv/bin/activate`
* add a python package to the main list: `pdm add [package]`
* add a python package to one of the dev list (among dev, maintain, quality, doc and test): `pdm add -dG [list] [package]`
* Run all tests: `pdm run pytest`
* Run only a subset of the tests: `pdm run pytest -k '[pattern_to_filter_tests]`. See [pytest doc](https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.2.x/usage.html#specifying-tests-selecting-tests)
* build the package's doc: `pdm doc`. This creates a `htmldoc` folder, which contains all the doc + tests results
* build the distributable python package: `pdm build`. This creates a `dist` folder with the generated package
* publish the distributable python package on artifactory: `pdm publish -r company`. **You must have tagged and pushed your tag just before this**

**In the case where you cloned package from bitbucket**

You can:
* create a venv: `pdm venv create python3.xx`
* tell pdm to use this venv: `pdm use --venv in-project`
* activate the venv: `source .venv/bin/activate`
* run `pdm install`. This will install all necessary packages to run the cloned pcakage
* add a python package to the main list: `pdm add [package]`
* add a python package to one of the dev list (among dev, maintain, quality, doc and test): `pdm add -dG [list] [package]`
* Run all tests: `pdm run pytest`
* Run only a subset of the tests: `pdm run pytest -k '[pattern_to_filter_tests]`. See [pytest doc](https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.2.x/usage.html#specifying-tests-selecting-tests)
* build the package's doc: `pdm doc`. This creates a `htmldoc` folder, which contains all the doc + tests results
* build the distributable python package: `pdm build`. This creates a `dist` folder with the generated package
